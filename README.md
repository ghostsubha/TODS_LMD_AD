# TODS_LMD_AD
Teleops vehicle Last mile delivery anomaly detection based on LSTM.
Platform is MATLAB 2024 (Toolbox: Simulink, Stattiscal, DL).
This repo provides the main files developed during the research project on physics-based anomaly detection in Teleoperated driving.
It contains, three sets of files for road vehicles with Electric-drive: EV1 is single motor, EV2 is dual motor and EV3 is quad motor configuration.
For each type of configuration the 1) Virtual Vehicle Configuration for data geenration with https://github.com/BehradToghi/D2CAV as a base , b) Vritual PLant Model, c) Attack scripts on sterring wheel angle are provided.
The LSTM model is as follows:
