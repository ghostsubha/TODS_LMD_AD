# TODS_LMD_AD
Teleops vehicle Last mile delivery anomaly detection based on LSTM.
Platform is MATLAB 2024 (Toolbox: Simulink, Stattiscal, DL).
This repo provides the main files developed during the research project on physics-based anomaly detection in Teleoperated driving.
It contains, three sets of files for road vehicles with Electric-drive: 1) EV1 is single motor, 2) EV2 is dual motor and 2) EV3 is quad motor configuration.
For each type of configuration the 1) Virtual Vehicle Configuration for data geenration with https://github.com/BehradToghi/D2CAV as a real-time base DATASET , 2) Vritual PLant Model, 3) Attack scripts on sterring wheel angle are provided.
The LSTM model is as follows:
